Overview

This repository contains projects that reflect my growth in front-end web development. I started by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, understanding how to structure web pages, and create layouts. As I progressed, I dived into CSS techniques for styling, such as Flexbox and Grid, for building responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Eventually, I incorporated JavaScript to bring interactivity and dynamic behavior to the static layouts.

The projects in this repository range from simple websites to more interactive web applications. Each project follows industry best practices and is a testament to my understanding of how web technologies come together to create engaging web experiences.

 Goals

The main goal of these projects is to build a solid foundation in front-end web development, ensuring that each project is:

1. Responsive: All projects are designed with responsiveness in mind. They adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops, ensuring a consistent user experience.
  
2. Accessible: Accessibility is an important part of web development. I've implemented best practices such as proper use of semantic HTML elements, alt texts for images, and keyboard navigation to ensure my projects are inclusive.

3. Scalable and Maintainable: The code in each project is structured in a way that makes it easy to read, maintain, and scale. I aim for simplicity, reusability, and clarity.

4. Optimized: I focus on performance, ensuring that the websites load quickly and efficiently, with clean and well-organized code. I also employ techniques like image optimization and CSS/JS minification when needed.
